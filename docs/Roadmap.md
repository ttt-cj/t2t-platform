We should operate with the MVP until we see a need for more features. Learn from the users and iterate. Intentionally keep the MVP simple, work on the spreadsheets. Have the focus on making it happen on the ground, than adding more features to the portal.

Next immediate steps:
 - Create a TRACE Github account and folk the repo
 - Create a google account and share the spreadsheets/AppScript project with the account
 - Host the site under t2t.trace.lk
 - Add a open source licencing to the repo (MIT licensing)
 - Complete the MVP
